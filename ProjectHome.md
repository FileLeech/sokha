`Sokha` is a web frontend for [plowshare](http://code.google.com/p/plowshare/). It allows you to download files from all the sites `plowshare` supports. It uses the [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) framework and it should work in any UNIX-like operating systems (GNU/Linux, BSD, Mac OSX, ...).

`Plowshare` is a downloader for Megaupload, Rapidshare, 2Shared, 4Shared, ZShare, Badongo, Divshare.com, Depositfiles, Mediafire, Netload.in, Storage.to, Uploaded.to, Uploading.com, Sendspace, Usershare, X7.to and some others sites.

## Status ##

The development of Sokha has been stopped, sorry!

## Notes ##

  * `Sokha` is in **pre-alpha state**, so it's probably only suitable for medium/advanced users willing to open as many issues as bugs the interface might have (right now, a lot!).

_In the region of Russia, a **sokha** (Russian: соха) was a light wooded plough which could be pulled by one horse. The historic sources show that it was in use in Russia at least since the 13th century. A characteristic feature of its construction is the bifurcated plowing tip (рассоха), so that a sokha has two plowshares, later made of metal, which cut the soil._ - [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokha)
