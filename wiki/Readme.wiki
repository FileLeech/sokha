#summary How to install Sokha.
#labels Featured,Phase-Requirements

= Introduction =

{{{Sokha}}} is a web frontend for [http://code.google.com/p/plowshare/ plowshare] that uses [http://www.sinatrarb.com/ Sinatra], a [http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/ Ruby] framework. In fact, _sokha_ does not only work with {{{plowshare}}}, as it's able to interface with (almost) any external command-line downloader.

= Dependencies =

 * [http://code.google.com/p/plowshare/ plowshare] (>= 0.9.4)
 * [http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/ Ruby] (>= 1.8.6)
 * [http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubygems/ Rubygems] (>= 1.2.0)
 * [http://rubyeventmachine.com/ Eventmachine]
 * [http://www.sinatrarb.com/ Sinatra]

Using {{{rubygems}}} you don't need to worry about these dependencies except for the backend ({{{plowshare}}}), {{{ruby}}} and {{{rubygems}}}.

== Update your rubygems version ==

{{{
$ sudo gem updateâ€”system
}}}

= Install =

== Create the gem ==

First of all, make sure you have {{{subversion}}} installed to access the code repository. Then run:

{{{
$ svn checkout http://sokha.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ sokha
$ cd sokha
$ gem build sokha.gemspec
}}}

== Install the gem ==

And install the newly created gem in your user directory:

{{{
$ gem install --user-install sokha-VERSION.gem
}}}

Or, if you prefer, make it available to all your users:

{{{
$ sudo gem install --no-user-install sokha-VERSION.gem
}}}

= Start the server =

== Find the {{{sokha}}} daemon executable ==

If you installed the gem on your home directory, chances are it's to be found in {{{$HOME/.gem/ruby/1.8/bin}}}. If you installed it in your system the path varies (check {{{/var/lib/gems/1.8/bin}}} or similar). 

Once you found it, add this bin path to your PATH variable (probably modifying {{{.bashrc}}}):

{{{
PATH=$PATH:/path/to/gems/bin
}}}

== Run the daemon ==

{{{
$ /path/to/sokhad start
}}}

And open your browser: http://localhost:4567 (admin/admin)

== Debugging ==

You run the daemon but the browser won't open the page. Probably something went wrong on the installation, try to run the daemon in the foreground and check the error messages:

{{{
$ /path/to/sokhad start -t
}}}

= Alternative backends =

For now {{{sokha}}} only works with {{{plowshare}}}, but this support is not  hardcoded, it should be possible to user other command-line downloaders, given they fulfill those requirerements:

 * Command-line application with no user interaction needed.
 * It returns the downloaded file in the standard output (and only that).
 * It has meaningful exit codes (so {{{sokha}}} can inform the user is something went wrong). 
 * It is able to return the _file-URL_ and the session's cookies (as a Netscape/mozilla text file) so {{{sokha}}} can make the actual file download.

== Contribute ==

The main configuration file should be the only thing to modify in _sokha_ to add support for other backends:

http://code.google.com/p/sokha/source/browse/trunk/config.yml

Take a look at the {{{apps.plowshare}}} section. Note that {{{sokha}}} is still in development and these specifications can change anytime to make room for more backends.

Backend contributions most welcome.
